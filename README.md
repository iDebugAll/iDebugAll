### Hi there 👋

As a NetDevOps Platform Owner in the financial sector and an industry-recognized expert, I'm a Cisco Champion (2021-2022) and a proud holder of Dubai’s Golden Visa for Specialized Talent. With over a decade in enterprise IT, I’ve built a strong foundation in technical leadership across several domains:

* 🤖 NetDevOps
* 🕸 Networking
* 🛠 IT Infrastructure Engineering and Automation
* ☎️ Unified Communications & Collaboration

</br>
Beyond technical expertise, I prioritize soft skills and effective team collaboration to drive strategic outcomes.</br> Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, surfing, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with the community.</br>
